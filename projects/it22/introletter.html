<h2>An introduction from Steve the Tour Master (otherwise known as the "Tour Bastard")</h2>

<p>For the people entering a Tour for the first time, it may seem like there is a lot to take in. But before you start thumbing through all the bonus locations, just spend a bit of time reading through the first pages of advice and instructions. Just go through it a few times and it will all start to make sense. It's not as complicated as it seems. If you have any questions just call me. If I don't answer, please leave a message and I will get back to you. </p>

<p><strong>Tour Phone 0790 8278797</strong> save this number on your phone, Any problems during the tour phone me
 (Office hours 9 to 5 please remember I go to bed early and get up late).</p>

<p>The whole idea of this tour is to test your route planning, navigation and observation, but most of all to have some fun and a great day's riding. If you find you are not enjoying it, STOP.</p>

<h2>Now a few friendly tips.</h2>
<p>Remember the new law regarding using phones and satnavs, I suggest you get off your bike to take pictures and send emails. </p>
<p>Do not try to do too much; I suspect that most riders will struggle to get 25 bonuses unless they go for the low value ones near the start, or are old hands at this type of event  </p>
<p>If you feel tired stop and just relax with your eyes shut. A 10-to-15-minute break will make all the difference.  </p>
<p>When you take your pictures make sure they are clear and look the exactly the same as the ones in the tour book. Pictures that are taken from a totally different angle or from a long distance away may not be accepted. You must remember that the people that are checking your pictures may have never been to the location, and when they see a picture that looks different to the example, they will reject it, and you will not get the bonus claim. Or they may refer it to me, and then you will find out why they call me the "<em>Tour Bastard</em>". </p>
<p>When you take your bonus-picture check the rules for each bonus. It is so easy to lose points because you forgot that you or your bike or pillion had to be in the picture. (Pillions must be in all pictures)</p>
<p>Make sure that your rally flag is not obscuring the bonus location when you take the picture.</p>
<p>You have been given two sizes of Tour flag. This is so you can hold the small on in your hand and take a picture. Or fix the larger one to the item you are photographing. So, you can take the picture from further away. You can use either tour flag, but it and the bonus item must be clear. </p>
<p>Before you leave the bonus that you have just claimed, refresh your memory regarding what you must look for at your next location. It's very easy to just ride past it if you're not sure what to look for. The locations given for the bonuses in the book are very accurate so stop where the waypoint is and have a good look around. What you are looking for won't be too far away.</p>
<p>If you are getting a bit low on fuel and you come upon a petrol station, don't think: “I've got 50 miles left in the tank; I'll get some petrol at the next petrol station”. This tour has been designed to keep you out in the countryside on quieter roads; there might not be another petrol station on your route. Get petrol when you can.  </p>
<p>Please get to the start location of the tour no more than 1/2 an hour before your allocated start time </p>
<p><strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER IS TO ENJOY THE DAY.</strong></p>
<p>Cheers Steve.   </p>
