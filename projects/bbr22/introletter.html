    <h2>Riders' Final Instructions</h2>

    <p>1. <strong>The Rally starts at 0630 on Saturday 17th.</strong> Please get to your bike around 0600, for Odometer readings to be taken before the Rally starts.</p>

    <p>2. <strong>You should return back here on Sunday 18th before 1730.</strong> There will be 100 penalty points per minute applied for any late arrival after 1730.</p>

    <p>3. <strong>If you return back here after 1830 you will be classed as a "Did Not Finish" (DNF).</strong></p>

    <p>4. You should ride safely and legally throughout the Rally. Park safely, legally, considerably, and observe any social distancing requirements if still needed. Anyone not adhering to the Brit Butt Rally rules will be automatically disqualified.</p>

    <p>5. The Rally team will apply a range of technical measures to detect speeding and any other bad behaviour. High speeding or bad behaviour will result in a disqualification.</p>

    <h2>Bonus point claims</h2>


    <p>1. This is an Electronic Bonus Claiming (EBC) event, involving you emailing your bonus claims throughout the rally. Each bonus claim will consist of a photograph as well as an odometer reading and a timestamp.</p>

    <p>2. The Rally timezone is British Summer Time (BST or GMT+1), and all times specified here and in emailed claims refer to that timezone.</p>

    <p>3. The Rally unit of distance is the status mile (1609.344 metres), and all reporting will use that unit. Odometer readings will be recorded as simple integers representing either miles or kilometres. Distances will be converted to miles automatically. Entrants must report simple odometer readings with no conversion from kilometres to miles.</p>

    <p>4. Claims for bonuses visited on Saturday must be received no later than 0030 Sunday. Claims for bonuses visited on Sunday must be received no later than 1830, or your interview with the Rallymaster, whichever is first.</p>

    <p>5. Claims must be emailed to:</p>

<h4>ibaukebc@gmail.com</h4>

<p>6. Emails must have the following in the Subject line:</p>

<h3>Your number Bonus number Odo 24hr time</h3>

<p>The four values must be separated just by spaces. Example below for rider #21, at bonus #45, Odometer showing 31,895 miles, and at 3:31pm :</p>

<h3>21 45 31895 1531</h3>

    <p>7. Emailed claims are transferred automatically to the scoring system. It only recognises this correct and spaced format.</p>

    <p>8. If you make several emailed claims for each bonus, then only the last one received will be accepted.</p>

    <p>9. After finishing the Rally and checking in, you will be shown a list of what claims you had made. You should check the list and resubmit any missing claims before 1830.</p>

    <h2>General photographs</h2>

    <p>1. You should take a photograph matching as closely as possible to the picture in this book. If the location is closed or missing, take and email additional photographic evidence, highlighting your problem. Such as a photo showing the coordinates on your GPS.</p>

    <p>2. You can also type in a description of any issues in the email. If in doubt, text or phone the Rallymaster.</p>

    <p>3. Your Rally flag showing your number must be in every photo. If you have to be in the photograph ensure that your face is visible, not just your hand holding the Rally flag. So lift up your flip-up helmet or take it off instead.</p>

    <p>4. If your bike has to be in the photo, try and show it all, not just the front screen, a top box, or a wing mirror.</p>
