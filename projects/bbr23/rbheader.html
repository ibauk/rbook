<h2>Rest bonuses</h2>

<p>1. You can claim at least six hours as rest bonus in a single rest period session. A rest period is started by claiming RB0 in the usual way, with a photo of a receipt next to your odometer. The end of the period is claimed using code RB6.</p>
<br>
<p>2. You may not claim any other bonuses during your rest period.</p>
<br>
<p>3. You can rest where you want. So maybe in a hotel or outside anywhere. Just get receipts to prove you stayed in one place, even if you have to ride a short distance in between the times you claim for i.e. maybe a receipt from a 24 hour fuel station.</p>
<br>
<p>4. Rest periods can only be taken between 1200 noon on Saturday and 1200 noon on Sunday.</p>
