    <h2>Bonus point claims</h2>


    <p>1. This is an Electronic Bonus Claiming (EBC) event, involving you emailing your bonus claims throughout the rally. Each bonus claim will consist of a photograph and some basic information as well as an odometer reading and a timestamp.</p>

    <p>2. The rally timezone is British Summer Time (BST or GMT+1), and all times specified here and in emailed claims refer to that timezone.</p>

    <p>3. The rally unit of distance is the statute mile (1609.344 metres), and all reporting will use that unit. Odometer readings will be recorded as simple integers representing either miles or kilometres. Distances will be converted to miles automatically. Entrants must report simple odometer readings with no conversion from kilometres to miles.</p>

    <p>4. Claims for bonuses visited on Saturday must be received no later than 0030 Sunday. Claims for bonuses visited on Sunday must be received no later than 1830, or before your finish odo check, whichever is first.</p>

    <p>5. Claims must be emailed to:</p>

<p>6. Emails must have the following in the Subject line:</p>

<h3><i>Rider Bonus Odo Time</i></h3>

<p>The four values must be separated just by spaces, not commas or other punctuation. Times are all 24 hour clock times. Example below for rider #21, at bonus '45', Odometer showing 31,895 miles, at 3:31pm :</p>

<h3>21 45 31895 1531</h3>

    <p>7. Emailed claims are transferred automatically to the scoring system. It only recognises this correct format, do not deviate.</p>

    <p>8. If you make several emailed claims for a particular bonus, then only the last one received will be accepted.</p>

    <p>9. When finishing the rally and checking in, you will be reminded to check your email and ensure that all claims have been correctly submitted. You should check and resubmit any missing claims before the final odo check.</p>
