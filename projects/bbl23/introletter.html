   You can use it for a nice day out and even visit some of the museums or you can unlock the puzzle and go for a high score. <br>
   Remember it's only a ride. <br>

   <h3>Bonus claiming</h3>
   <p>1 Your flag must be clearly visible in all your photos;
    Pillions or one member of a team must be in every photo<br>
   2 The coordinates are where I parked and took most of the photos. If the bonus is not easily visible follow the <img class="icon" src="{{.ImageFolder}}alertalert.png" alt="A"> instruction under the photo<br>
   3 Your picture must match the one in this book<br>
   4 Send your picture by email to ibaukebc@gmail.com using only the email you used to enter.<br>
      Only one picture per email. If you make a mistake send another email and the last one will be scored.<br>
   5 The email SUBJECT line should be FOUR FIELDS separated by SPACES only</p>
   
   <p>Example: Rider Number, Bonus number, odo reading, claim time</p>
      
   <p class="center hilite">12 52 27234 1012</p>
   
   <p>Take Care the Brit Butt Light is scored automatically using your email subject line.</p>
   
   <h3>Scoring</h3>
   <p>On your return ensure all your emails have been cleared from your phone before the odo check when your rally finishes and no more claims will be accepted.
   You will be given a print out of your claims showing the reason any claims were unsuccessful. </p>
   
   <h4>READ VERY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND POINTS SYSTEM</h4>
   <p>There are two types of bonuses</p>
   <p><strong>Scoring</strong>.		Points are the value of that bonus. eg 122	<br>
   <strong>Multipliers</strong>.	Points are the multiplier times the points value of the last bonus claimed. eg x4</p>

   <p>                             There are no points for a multiplier after a multiplier.</p>
   <p>Be careful: If you claim a scoring bonus incorrectly you will also lose the following multiplier even if it is correctly claimed</p>
   
   <h4>NOW READ IT AGAIN</h4>
