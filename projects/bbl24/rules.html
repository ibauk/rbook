  <h3>Bonus collecting</h3>
  <p>
    D1: The rally is not a scavenger hunt. We expect you to follow the
    instructions for the bonus.

    be on the flag.
  </p>

    It is the rider's responsibility to make sure that they send the correct
    photo with the correct details on the email.
  </p>

  <p>
    D4: Each rider will receive a unique rally flag. Do not lose it. It will not
    be replaced. If you lose your flag, you may continue collecting bonus points
    on the condition that your face is clearly visible in all subsequent photos
    along with the bonus item. If you are riding with a pillion or as a team all
    riders must be in the photo. Once a bonus is claimed using this exemption,
    your rally flag ceases to be valid and may not be used again, even if it is
    found.

    with if discovered on the rally.
  </p>

  <p>

    every photo. If the bonus states “face in photo” then both of you must
    appear.
  </p>

  <p>
    D7: There will be no bonus claim sheets. Scoring will be collated during the
    rally from the pictures emailed in. You need to take great care that your
    pictures comply with the rules and rally book.
  </p>

  <p>
    D8: All pictures that do not comply will be reviewed by the rally team whose
    decision is final.
  </p>

    any bonus claims disallowed and the reason(s) why.
